# Contributing

Golden rule; don't be someone your dog/cat/grandmother would be disappointed in.

## How to contribute

### Raise a bug report

Found a bug? Please raise an issue in the issue tracker attached to the repo. Please be as detailed as possible in your
description and if you want us to _really_ love you - an example repo that reproduces the issue makes you the best person.

### Submit a pull request

Want to fix a bug or add a feature? Please submit a pull request!

We reserve the right to reject pull requests that don't meet our standards, or veer away from the project's goals, or
potentially increase the scope beyond a reasonable level of effort to maintain.

If you're unsure about whether a feature would be a good fit - please use the Discussions or Issue tracker to discuss it
to save you wasting effort.

Forks are also welcome and encouraged - it's open source, be open! Please try to contribute back if you can though.

### Ask questions in Discussions

If you have general questions, or want advice, use the Discussions tab.

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/). Again, don't make your grandma cry.
